The panel at the CNTR/CTY Cocktails and Conversation: Connecting Tech event at Capital Factory and Boeing Center at Tech Port yesterday evening was excellent. It's inspiring to see how far the Tech sector has come in San Antonio in the last few decades.

We thrive on open, honest conversations about our challenges. These discussions empower us to create actionable plans and drive progress. While our city has a long journey ahead, I'm inspired by the dedicated, capable leaders who are committed to our success. I'm excited about the important work we have to do together.

Shout out to Ileana Gonzalez, Rene Dominguez, Will Garrett, Gabriele Niederauer, PhD, and Charles Woodin for the great discussion.
