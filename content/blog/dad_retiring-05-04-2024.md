My father, Larry Anderson graduated from the University of Texas with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1971. He immediately gained employment at a small pharmaceutical company called Texas Pharmacal where he maintained consistent employment until retirement 5 months ago. Over his 53 year career, the company and or division was sold or changed names multiple times including Dermatological Products of Texas (DPT), DFB, Healthpoint Biotherapeutics, and Smith & Nephew. Beyond the initial employment offer, he never had to apply for a job or update his resume.
 
This past weekend I had the opportunity to spend an evening with a large group of friends, family, and his coworkers at his retirement party. So many people had such wonderful things to say about him that at times I was almost moved to tears. I'm deeply proud of my father and his accomplishments. He is a true renaissance man and a rare breed that I greatly admire.
