This past week I attended so many great [San Antonio Startup Week](https://sasw.co) sessions that it's hard to pick my favorite. There were quite a few amazing speakers and panels. So many great new connections made and existing relationships kindled.

The Gaming Summit on Sunday was fun and my son had a great time. The [Stumberg Pitch Competition](https://trinity.edu/directory/departments-offices/center-innovation-and-entrepreneurship/co-curricular-experiences/stumberg) at [Trinity University](https://trinity.edu/) was exciting and all the teams were amazing. Thursday started with a great talk by [Dr Harvey Castro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harveycastromd/) at [VelocityTX](https://velocitytx.org/) followed by a rooftop brunch at [Alamo Angels](https://alamoangels.com/) new offices. Of course I'd be remiss if I didn't call out the panel I participated on. A few of my fellow board members (Travis Runty, Alfonso García, and Hajar Moshirsadri), our CEO Beto Altamirano, and I had the opportunity to discuss the state of [Tech Bloc](https://satechbloc.com/) and our vision for the organization. The day concluded with our incredible Tech Bloc mixer on the beautiful rooftop of 300 Main backed by picture perfect weather and a gorgeous Texas sunset. All of these events were a great reminder that the future is bright for our city and how exciting it is to be part of that.

But I keep thinking back to the Founders & Investors Speed Networking event where I had the opportunity to represent [Tú TeleDoc](https://tuteledoc.com) in a series of 3 minute pitches to over a dozen investors. To those that already knew about me and our mission, I had the opportunity to provide some updates on our additional partnerships and go-to-market opportunities that are growing by the day. For those that I had not met yet, I was able to give a rapid summary of what we are building, why we are building it and why this team, my team, is well positioned to being this much needed service to market to an under-served community. I got to tell my story.

I finished the event feeling like I had just run a 5k. Equal parts exhausted and exhilarated because I am so passionate about what we are doing. I could have gone on for hours and I can't wait to follow-up with all of the investors and advisors I spoke with.

Thank you Juan Sebastian Garzon, Charles Woodin, Alfonso García, and Hajar Moshirsadri for organizing this event. I hope we are able to include it at Startup Week again in the future and perhaps expand it.
