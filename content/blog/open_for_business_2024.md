Hey there, everyone! Today I'm excited to share with you that I'm now open to part-time and flexible fractional CTO roles. 

So, you've heard the term "Fractional CTO" and you're wondering what it means and why you might need one. Here's the summary:

As companies get bigger, they often realize they don't have enough expert technology know-how on their leadership team. This can lead to problems like not having enough staff, not being able to keep an eye on things effectively, and not communicating well with the technology team.

Sometimes, the CTO position becomes vacant and they need a quick-fix solution or someone to work part-time. And sometimes an experienced CTO just needs some “extra hands” to assist with some key projects.

A Fractional CTO can help solve these problems by providing expert advice in different areas, such as:
- Making solid plans for using technology
- Building and mentoring great technology teams
- Helping developers and other IT people overcome obstacles
- Making sure that the most important technologies are scalable and secure
- Finding and fixing problems with technology
- Putting together a product roadmap

As many companies grow in size and complexity, they find that they lack technology experts on their executive team. This can result in challenges staffing, overseeing, and communicating with the technology staff. Or perhaps your organization currently lacks a CTO, leaving you to temporarily assume the role while seeking a suitable replacement. Alternatively, the workload at your company may not yet necessitate a full-time role.

I bring to the table nearly 30 years of experience in the technology sector. More than 20 of those years have been in one form of leadership or another. I have experience in industries as varied as Fintech, Healthcare Tech, Backup & Disaster Recovery, and Cloud/Managed Hosting. I’ve used nearly every technology stack under the sun and helped build and grow Software Engineering and Product Management teams.

Please don't hesitate to contact me through LinkedIn, directly from my website, or by sending an email to cto@nathananderson.com to schedule a free one-hour consultation. This will give me the opportunity to better understand your organization's requirements and determine how I can offer the best possible service.
