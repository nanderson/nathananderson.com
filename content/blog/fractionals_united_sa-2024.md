Bronson Ma and I hosted the inaugural Fractionals United® (FrUn) San Antonio meeting earlier today. Great conversations and collaboration with industry leaders solving all of our Fractional-related challenges.

If you are a fractional executive in the San Antonio area and want to participate, please join FrUn. DM me and I'll walk you through the free & simple process. If you're already a member, we'll publicize the meet-up in the loc-texas channel.

Look out for our next meet-up on Wednesday, August 28th. 👀
