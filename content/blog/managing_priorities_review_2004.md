I recently finished reading Managing Priorities by Harry Max. The book goes into detail on a method of structuring your prioritization exercises called DEGAP (Decide, Engage, Gather, Arrange, and Prioritize). A lot of times it takes putting together new ideas as well as methods we've already been using and getting that into a structured format so that we can solve these kinds of problems in a more regular and repeatable manner. 

The book is quite timely in the sense that I'm working with several companies who are having this very type of problem and I've recently had conversations with several other fractional executives regarding their struggles with prioritization.

If your Software Engineering team is struggling with too many priorities, conflicting priorities or rapidly changing priorities these tools can help you. Does your team need help with this?
