Early in my career, I was fortunate enough to find myself at a small hosting company that gave me a chance. They didn't have much cash in the bank but they had a lot of smart people with big ideas and even bigger dreams. One of the people that left a long-lasting huge impression on me was "Mamma" Karla. She set the tone for our culture and she kept all of us kids in line. Last night we celebrated her and her well-deserved retirement.

I learned a lot of lessons from my 15 years at Rackspace. Lessons about technology and leadership and friendship and life. And some of those lessons I learned from Karla. Listening before judging, servant leadership, the value of treating people like friends and family and many more.

Thank you Karla for being part of my life. Now go enjoy retirement with your loving husband.
