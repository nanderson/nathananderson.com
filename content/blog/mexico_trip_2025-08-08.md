This past week I had the pleasure of attending AWS Summit Ciudad de México 2025 on behalf of my new venture, Tú TeleDoc alongside a couple of my incredible co-founders. Things are heating up and we are building great relationships with our partners. I'll be talking more very soon about what we're creating but I wanted to give a little insight into the early magic.

Several months ago I connected with a few old coworkers who were in the early-ideation phase of something big. Something that has the potential to make a big difference in healthcare. The more they told me about this early idea and opportunity the more it hit home for me that this was something I wanted to be a part of for a number of reasons.

For starters, we are removing the barriers to Telehealth access in LATAM. We are bringing much needed healthcare to an under-served community in a way that that can make a big difference in peoples lives. It's hard not to get motivated by a mission like this.

Another connection I have to this idea is that to a certain degree, healthcare is "the family business" in my life. Between Doctors, Pharmacists, Nurses, and Pharmaceutical Chemists, I've been surrounded by family members in the field my entire life. My Grandfather delivered me and my father recently retired from a 53 year career in pharmaceutical chemistry with patents in wound care treatments and other amazing contributions. Chances are you have products in your bathroom cabinet that he had a part in formulating.

But for me, this effort is even more personal than all that. I've been on a health journey of my own in the last 2 years, one that I don't normally talk about publicly. While I have had my share of scary moments, I've been privileged to have such a great support system and easy access to high quality healthcare professionals the whole time. Not everybody is this fortunate.

This access issue is something we can solve for a population deserving of care. Stay tuned!!!
