Every so often in life, we are lucky enough to be part of something so special that the people who share that journey with you become family. I am fortunate to have been given the opportunity to go through Leadership San Antonio with this incredible team.

Thank you to the steering committee and our amazing Co-Chairs. Thank you to the Greater San Antonio Chamber and San Antonio Hispanic Chamber of Commerce for putting together such a great program. Thank you to all of my classmates. And thank you to SWIVEL (and CyberFortress) for sponsoring me on this journey.
