Last night was one of those “refill the tank” kind of evenings.

I had the chance to celebrate the [ProsperOps](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prosperops) team on their recent exit at a fabulous event put together by [Alamo Angels](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alamoangelsofsa). Founded by a group of former Rackers I’ve respected for years, they built a great product I have used across multiple companies and a culture that reminds me of the golden days at Rackspace: high trust, high ownership, and deep care for customers and each other.

Hearing Pat Matthews talk about his journey with them really landed for me. From casual advice, to an early investment, to helping them navigate the messy middle of startup life, it was a powerful reminder of how much the right mentors can change the trajectory of a company. And as always, Graham Weston shared some of his incredible insights for both founders and investors.

At [Tú TeleDoc](https://tuteledoc.com/) , [Dr. Jeremy Roberts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyaroberts/) and I have been very intentional about building that same kind of support system for ourselves. I’ve led teams and products of all sizes, but this pre‑revenue, early‑stage journey is still new territory for me and I’m leaning into it with humility and excitement.
Big shout-out as well to [Juan Sebastian Garzon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juansebastiangarzon/), [Francisco García](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franciscoemmanuel/), [Michael McElmeel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-m-07146a171/) and the entire Alamo Angels community for building such a strong network here in Texas. I’m grateful to be a small part of that extended family. 🚀

Nights like this make the hard days of startup life feel absolutely worth it. 🙌
