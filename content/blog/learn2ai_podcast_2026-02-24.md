### Guiding Questions
- The Rackspace Legacy: You spent over 15 years at Rackspace. How did witnessing the birth of the managed cloud shape your philosophy on "Infrastructure as a Service" and customer-centric engineering?
- The "Socializer" CTO: Your Culture Index and DiSC profiles (Socializer/iS) suggest a highly relational approach to a traditionally "heads-down" role. How does being a "Relator" help you bridge the gap between complex DevOps and product strategy?
- The Startup "Diagnostic": Through your consulting work, you help startups facing "piling up tech debt" and delivery issues. What is the most common cultural issue that causes these technical failures?
- Global Impact: With Tú TeleDoc, you are tackling healthcare accessibility in Latin America. What are the unique technical hurdles of building a platform meant to function "anytime, anywhere" for an underserved market?
- Mergers & Integration: You’ve led several engineering organizations through acquisitions and brand unifications (SWIVEL, CyberFortress, Chargify). How do you maintain team engagement when two distinct engineering cultures collide?
- AI & DevOps: As a leader in DevOps and Infrastructure, where do you see AI providing the most significant "operational overhead" reduction for engineering teams right now?
- San Antonio Tech: As a Tech Bloc Board Member and Leadership San Antonio alum, what is the "state of the union" for the San Antonio tech ecosystem in 2026?
