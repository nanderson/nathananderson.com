Friday evenings, Byte Nights:
Byte Night is a laid-back gathering for programmers, tech folks, indie hackers, and curious minds in San Antonio who just want to hang out, talk shop, share ideas, and code together.



Prep questions:
- Introduction
- What was the tech scene like when you were coming up, and how has it changed?
- A lot of talented people leave for Austin, the coasts, or bigger markets. You stayed. Why?
- You've mentioned that great leaders insulate their teams from distractions while still communicating what matters. How did you develop that philosophy?
- TechBloc has been rallying San Antonio's tech community since 2015. From your seat, what's working? What still needs attention?
- For someone early in their career here in San Antonio—maybe a developer who wants to grow into leadership—what would you tell them?
- What's one thing about San Antonio's tech community that deserves more recognition? 
- Where can people connect with you or get involved with TechBloc?
