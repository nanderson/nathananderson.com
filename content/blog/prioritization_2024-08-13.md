I often get asked by CEOs and tech founders to help them figure out or confirm their technology roadmap. It's usually for startups that don't have a product leader yet, and the founder is making all the decisions about what to prioritize.

🛑 Before I jump into the existing roadmap or even ask about ideas for upcoming work, I like to start by digging into the process they're currently using to prioritize their work and plan their roadmaps.

It can be as simple as four basic steps:
1. Define your vision and goals.
2. Identify key initiatives and milestones.
3. Create a visual roadmap considering (1) and (2).
4. Communicate, communicate, communicate.

If you have a consistent and reliable process for building and regularly maintaining a roadmap, you're much more likely to reach your goals. 🏆

Do you have a system for figuring out what's most important for your business and putting it on a roadmap? If not, I can lend a hand. Building believable roadmaps is harder than it sounds and is more complex than just these 4 basic steps but I can walk you through it.
