This week I concluded an amazing 13 months at Swivel. Along the way I met some truly incredible people and built relationships that I will always treasure. I reflect back on all the things we accomplished during this past year and I am overwhelmed with a sense of pride. Product launches (including a record implementation time for Chase Global Payments), business units roll-out, Product+Engineering relationship reset, a highly successful acquisition, re-building cross-functional organization relationships, the beginnings of moving security left, 1st ever Engineering in-person team building event ... and I could go on and on.

I'm incredibly proud of what we have been able to accomplish as a company and even more proud of my Engineering teams. You inspire me.

I'm fortunate to have made some truly incredible friendships along the way. I know in my heart that I'll be seeing, and even working with, many of you in the future.

My heart is full from all the hugs and tears this week. We flew in a large number of people from out of town for a 2 year Swivel branding anniversary party. That meant I was able to see so many of my close coworkers in person and celebrate with them. The extrovert in me couldn't have been more happy.

I wrote the ending of this particular chapter of my career with forethought and purpose. For a few key reasons, the timing in my life makes perfect sense. Very, very soon I'll announce what I'm doing next. Spoiler alert, I'm INCREDIBLY excited about it!!!!!

For now, I just want to say THANK YOU and stay tuned.
