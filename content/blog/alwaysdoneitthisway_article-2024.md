"We have always done it this way"

7 of the most expensive words in technology.

If you want to improve the productivity and employee engagement (which go hand-in-hand by the way) of your Software Engineering organization you likely need to change the way you operate. Don't be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and challenge basic assumptions about how your organization is structured, processed for work flowing through the organization, and even people you have in various roles.

Sometimes the changes that need to be made to unlock dramatic improvement are quite simple, and sometimes they may be more difficult.

Rest assured, in most instances, the effects of these targeted changes will become apparent in a relatively short period of time.

An external perspective can sometimes provide valuable insights into an organization's decision-making and processes. If you're looking for assistance in this area, please don't hesitate to reach out.
