## Summary

I have seen lots of technology stacks come and go throughout my career. The only constant is change, as they say. And this new AI revolution is certainly the biggest and most exciting shift I have ever since the "mainframe to PC", "internet", and "dedicated to cloud hosting" revolutions. Change is scary but be careful of the hype.

At the end of the day it's still a people driven system.

I sat down with [Dan Villa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-villa/) from [Jemini](https://jemini.io/) on a podcast recently to talk about all things tech, AI, and tech culture.
